This is the wild west. Do whatever you want. Nobody will judge you for the code. Code should probably compile, but no big deal if it doesn't. People generally shouldn't assume code here will be the final version or that it will ever make it to production. Create your own folder for work or a new folder for each project you work on. Generally don't change code in a folder that you didn't create here unless you are working closely with the origional creator.
