This folder holds code that is still actively a work in progress but is somewhat finalized and certainly should compile at all stages. Breaking changes are discouraged and it is fine although somewhat dangerous to build code to the specs presented by code in this folder.

Code here should include a Makefile for compilation or be a valid ROS package.
